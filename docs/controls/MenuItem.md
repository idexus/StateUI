# MenuItem

One entry in a menu.

Layer: `structure`. It carries structure or protocol data rather than configuring a visual platform object.

Inherits: [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md) · [MenuItemElement](tiers/MenuItemElement.md)

Marks: ✅ proven by every test of it that ran on that host · ☑️ proven, the host recording what is missing · – never on that host's family, which meets the contract there · ❌ a test of it failed · ◐ some of its tests proved it, another could not run or read · 🔌 proven only through the host's own entry or record, not the toolkit's · · the driver cannot yet do or read what its test needs · ⏸ its test waits on a member the host does not realize · ⌛ said at another revision of its family than it stands at · empty: not realized, or no run - the note says which. See [the dictionary](README.md).

## MenuItem's own members

MenuItem declares no members of its own.

## From [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md)

What anything carrying values in the tree has - a control, a `Style`, a text run: the name automation finds it by.

| `accessibilityIdentifier` | property | `String` | native |  |  |  | ✅ |  |  |  |

## From [MenuItemElement](tiers/MenuItemElement.md)

What every item a user chooses from has - a menu's entry, a toolbar's item: a caption, a picture, and something to run.
