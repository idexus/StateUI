# NavigationStack

A page holding a native stack of pages, with a bar and a back affordance.

Layer: `adaptive`. Every base host presents it by its platform's conventions, keeping StateUI's state contract.

Inherits: [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md) · [BarElement](tiers/BarElement.md) · [PageElement](tiers/PageElement.md)

Marks: ✅ realized by that host and covered by its tests · ☑️ realized and tested, but incomplete - the note says what is missing · – not planned for that host's family, which meets the contract there - the note says why · empty: absent, partial and unverified, or not looked at yet. See [the dictionary](README.md).

Declared in `lib/StateUI/Sources/Contracts/Elements/Navigation/NavigationStackContract.swift`.

## From [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md)

What anything carrying values in the tree has - a control, a `Style`, a text run: the name automation finds it by.
