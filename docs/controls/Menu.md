# Menu

A menu: a caption and the entries it opens - on the menu bar, or one level down inside another menu.

Layer: `structure`. It carries structure or protocol data rather than configuring a visual platform object.

Inherits nothing: every member below is its own.

Marks: ✅ realized by that host and covered by its tests · ☑️ realized and tested, but incomplete - the note says what is missing · – not planned for that host's family, which meets the contract there - the note says why · empty: absent, partial and unverified, or not looked at yet. See [the dictionary](README.md).

Declared in `lib/StateUI/Sources/Contracts/Elements/Menus/MenuContract.swift`.
