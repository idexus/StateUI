# Menu

A menu: a caption and the entries it opens - on the menu bar, or one level down inside another menu.

Layer: `structure`. It carries structure or protocol data rather than configuring a visual platform object.

Inherits nothing: every member below is its own.

Marks: ✅ proven on that host by its own passing test · ☑️ proven by its test, but the host records what is missing - the note says what · – never on that host's family, which meets the contract there - its register says why · empty: not proven on that host yet. See [the dictionary](README.md).

Declared in `lib/StateUI/Sources/Contracts/Elements/Menus/MenuContract.swift`.

## Menu's own members

| Member | Kind | Value | Layer | AppKit | UIKit | GTK 4 | Android Views | WinUI 3 | Web | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| `isEnabled` | property | `Bool` | native |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| `text` | property | `String` | native |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Realization:

- **AppKit**: `NSMenu` / `NSMenuItem`
- **UIKit**: `UIMenu` / `UIAction`
- **GTK 4**: `GMenu` in `GtkPopoverMenu` / `GtkPopoverMenuBar`
- **Android Views**: `PopupMenu` / `MenuItem`; no menu bar
- **WinUI 3**: `MenuFlyout` / `MenuBar`
- **Web**: ARIA `menu` / `menubar` (?)
