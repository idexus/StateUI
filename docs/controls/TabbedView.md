# TabbedView

A page showing several pages, one at a time, with a bar to choose between them.

Layer: `adaptive`. Every base host presents it by its platform's conventions, keeping StateUI's state contract.

Inherits: [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md) · [BarElement](tiers/BarElement.md) · [PageElement](tiers/PageElement.md)

Marks: ✅ proven by every test of it that ran on that host · ☑️ proven, the host recording what is missing · – never on that host's family, which meets the contract there · ❌ a test of it failed · ◐ some of its tests proved it, another could not run or read · 🔌 proven only through the host's own entry or record, not the toolkit's · · the driver cannot yet do or read what its test needs · ⏸ its test waits on a member the host does not realize · ⌛ said at another revision of its family than it stands at · empty: not realized, or no run - the note says which. See [the dictionary](README.md).

| Host | Created | Members (6) | Realization | Notes |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| AppKit |  |  | `NSTabView`: tabless under a full-width select-one `NSSegmentedControl` beneath the toolbar - the split view detail's `NSSplitViewItemAccessoryViewController` on macOS 26 and later, else the title bar's bottom accessory - with top tabs where no window serves it | no run of it on these sources |
| UIKit |  |  | `UITabBarController` | no run of it on these sources |
| Android Views |  |  | Material Components `BottomNavigationView` (?) | no run of it on these sources |
| WinUI 3 | ✅ | 4 ✅ | `NavigationView` with a top pane |  |
| GTK 4 |  |  | `GtkStack` + `GtkStackSwitcher`; libadwaita `AdwViewStack` | no run of it on these sources |
| Web |  |  | ARIA `tablist` | no host yet |

Declared in `lib/StateUI/Sources/Contracts/Elements/Navigation/TabbedViewContract.swift`.

## From [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md)

What anything carrying values in the tree has - a control, a `Style`, a text run: the name automation finds it by.
