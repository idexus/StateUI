# ContextMenu

The menu a view offers where the user asks for one - a secondary click, a long press.

Layer: `structure`. It carries structure or protocol data rather than configuring a visual platform object.

Inherits nothing: every member below is its own.

Marks: ✅ realized by that host and covered by its tests · ☑️ realized and tested, but incomplete - the note says what is missing · empty: absent, partial and unverified, or not looked at yet. See [the dictionary](README.md).

Declared in `lib/StateUI/Sources/Contracts/Elements/ContextMenuContract.swift`.

## ContextMenu's own members

ContextMenu declares no members of its own.

Realization:

- **MAUI**: `MenuFlyout` / `MenuBarItem`
- **AppKit**: `NSMenu` / `NSMenuItem`
- **UIKit**: `UIMenu` / `UIAction`
- **GTK 4**: `GMenu` in `GtkPopoverMenu` / `GtkPopoverMenuBar`
- **Android Views**: `PopupMenu` / `MenuItem`; no menu bar
- **WinUI 3**: `MenuFlyout` / `MenuBar`
- **Web**: ARIA `menu` / `menubar` (?)
