# TitleBar

An authored title area attached to a window.

Layer: `adaptive`. Every base host presents it by its platform's conventions, keeping StateUI's state contract.

Inherits: [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md) · [VisualElement](tiers/VisualElement.md) · [View](tiers/View.md)

Marks: ✅ proven by every test of it that ran on that host · ☑️ proven, the host recording what is missing · – never on that host's family, which meets the contract there · ❌ a test of it failed · ◐ some of its tests proved it, another could not run or read · 🪞 proven only through the host's own entry or record, not the toolkit's · · the driver cannot yet do or read what its test needs · ⏸ its test waits on a member the host does not realize · ⌛ said by a run of other sources than these · empty: not realized, or no run - the note says which. See [the dictionary](README.md).

## From [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md)

What anything carrying values in the tree has - a control, a `Style`, a text run: the name automation finds it by.

What every drawn element has: its size and its bounds, how it is shown and turned, whether it answers input and holds the keyboard focus, the visual states it enters, and what a screen reader says about it.

## From [View](tiers/View.md)

What every view a layout positions has: where it sits in its layout, the space kept around it, and the gestures, drags and frame reports it answers.
