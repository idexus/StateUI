# Line

A straight line between two points, in device units from the top left of the space the line is given.

Layer: `stateUI`. StateUI composes it from smaller primitives before a host receives the tree.

| Mark | Meaning |
| :---: | --- |
| ✅ | Proven by every test of it that ran on that host. |
| ☑️ | Proven, the host recording what is missing. |
| – | Never on that host's family, which meets the contract there. |
| ❌ | A test of it failed. |
| ◐ | Some of its tests proved it, another could not run or read. |
| 🔌 | Proven only through the host's own entry or record, not the toolkit's. |
| · | The driver cannot yet do or read what its test needs. |
| ⏸ | Its test waits on a member the host does not realize. |
| ⌛ | Said at another revision of its family than it stands at. |
| empty | Not realized, or no run - the note says which. |

See [the dictionary](README.md) for how a mark is given.

## From [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md)

What anything carrying values in the tree has - a control, a `Style`, a text run: the name automation finds it by.

## From [VisualElement](tiers/VisualElement.md)

What every drawn element has: its size and its bounds, how it is shown and turned, whether it answers input and holds the keyboard focus, the visual states it enters, and what a screen reader says about it.

## From [View](tiers/View.md)

What every view a layout positions has: where it sits in its layout, the space kept around it, and the gestures, drags and frame reports it answers.

What every drawn shape has: what fills it, the line around it, how it fits its room, and a transform of its own drawing.
